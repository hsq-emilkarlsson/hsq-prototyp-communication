# GitHub Pages Setup Instructions

## Automatic Deployment is Configured! ðŸŽ‰

This project is already configured for automatic deployment to GitHub Pages. When you push to the main branch, the site will automatically build and deploy.

## Setup Steps

1. **Push your code to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Final portal improvements and GitHub Pages setup"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Enable GitHub Pages in your repository settings:**
   - Go to your repository on GitHub
   - Click "Settings" tab
   - Scroll down to "Pages" in the sidebar
   - Under "Source", select "GitHub Actions"
   - The workflow will automatically trigger on your next push

3. **Your site will be available at:**
   ```
   https://hsq-emilkarlsson.github.io/hsq-prototyp-communication/
   ```

## Manual Deployment (if needed)

If you prefer to deploy manually:

```bash
# Build the project
npm run build

# The dist/ folder contains the built site
# Upload the contents of dist/ to any web server
```

## Development

Continue developing locally with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The site will be available at `http://localhost:3000/hsq-prototyp-communication/`

## Next Steps

1. Push your code to trigger the first deployment
2. Check the Actions tab in GitHub to monitor the deployment
3. Visit your live site once deployment completes
4. Continue making improvements - each push to main will auto-deploy!
